My github account is just me starting out how to code collaboratively (and code in the first place for that matter). The hope is that this will eventually be my professional github account.  

This repository is me learning the very basics of github.

I then used Visual Studio Code to edit the README file with the above text/information. I saved my progress in VSC and then committed the branch to main with the GitHub desktop application.
